        <h3>Plans for the site.</h3>

        <p>Well, my site is pretty bare at the moment, and it's in a pretty rough state. But I've been having a blast so
            far, and so
            I plan to update it regularly. And now that I feel pretty comfortable with Lua, I'm going to start spending
            some time learning
            Javascript and website-y stuff, and hopefully get some interactive elements going. But first I definitely
            need to get the static
            site cleaned up and make it mobile friendly. I feel pretty decent about how it's turned out so far, but it's
            definitely a learning
            process.
        </p>

        <p>I have some ideas churning around in the old noggin (explains the burning smell), so definitely check back
            later, hopefully it'll
            end up being pretty slick. Thanks for visiting!
