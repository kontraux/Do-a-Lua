        <h3>Update</h3>
        <p>I think it's pretty clear that I have no idea what I'm doing. I didn't even know what a router was, but <a href="https://github.com/DesignerJennifer">Jen</a>
            said I would definitely want one. And damn, she was right, I can dig it. It took a couple days of looking at tutorials and gists, but I think
            after I finally started getting everything sorted out, the one I wrote works (more or less) how it's supposed to. I vaguely knew that all the
            really sharp sites dynamically loaded in HTML, but that was about it. I'm starting to see all the cool stuff I'll eventually be able to do,
            adding in more functions, packaging everything as neat components, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>I got the main stuff hooked up, I'm sure there are still some old broken links and missing divs that I had embedded into the HTML. There's
            still some inline styling and I'm sure the CSS page could use some work. Some of the router code is mine but some I pretty much lifted
            directly from tutorials, and I don't really like how it looks. I am going to try to get everything either in functables or pass functions
            as arguments into the template engine or something. I'm sure it can be improved (at least to my eye). That's all okay though,
            I'm pretty sure no one has seen this site yet except my family, and they always have nice stuff to say about what I'm working on.
        </p>
        <p>So, a lot of cleanup to do, and I definitely need some more articles. But so far, I'm super happy with how things are going. More to come
            soon!
        </p>

        <h3>Plans for the site.</h3>

        <p>Well, my site is pretty bare at the moment, and it's in a pretty rough state. But I've been having a blast so
            far, and so
            I plan to update it regularly. And now that I feel pretty comfortable with Lua, I'm going to start spending
            some time learning
            Javascript and website-y stuff, and hopefully get some interactive elements going. But first I definitely
            need to get the static
            site cleaned up and make it mobile friendly. I feel pretty decent about how it's turned out so far, but it's
            definitely a learning
            process.
        </p>

        <p>I have some ideas churning around in the old noggin (explains the burning smell), so definitely check back
            later, hopefully it'll
            end up being pretty slick. Thanks for visiting!
