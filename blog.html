        <h3>Router Update</h3>
        <p>I think it's pretty clear that I have no idea what I'm doing. I didn't even know what a router was, but <a href="https://github.com/DesignerJennifer">Jen</a>
            said I would definitely want one. And she was right, I can dig it. It took a couple days to figure out, but I think
            I am getting it all sorted out, and the one I wrote works (more or less) how it's supposed to. Probably makes less sense for a small
            personal site than a web app, but I think doing stuff like this is helping me to get comfortable in Javascript. I definitely see some things
            that need fixed and cleaned up, but overall I'm super pleased with how everything is going so far!
        </p>

        <h3>Plans for the site.</h3>

        <p>Well, my site is pretty bare at the moment, and it's in a pretty rough state. But I've been having a blast so
            far, and so I plan to update it regularly. And now that I feel pretty comfortable with Lua, I'm going to start spending
            some time learning Javascript and website-y stuff, and hopefully get some interactive elements going. But first I definitely
            need to get the static site cleaned up and make it mobile friendly. I feel pretty decent about how it's turned out so far, but it's
            definitely a learning process.
        </p>

        <p>I have some ideas churning around in the old noggin (explains the burning smell), so definitely check back later, hopefully it'll
            end up being pretty slick. Thanks for visiting!
