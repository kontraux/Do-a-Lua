    <h3>Plans for the site.</h3>

    <p>Well, my site is pretty bare at the moment, and it's in a pretty rough state. But I've been having a blast so far, and so
        I plan to update it regularly. And now that I feel pretty comfortable with Lua, I'm going to start spending some time learning
        Javascript and website-y stuff, and hopefully get some interactive elements going. But first I definitely need to get the static
        site cleaned up and make it mobile friendly. I feel pretty decent about how it's turned out so far, but it's definitely a learning
        process.
    </p>

    <p>I have some ideas churning around in the old noggin (explains the burning smell), so definitely check back later, hopefully it'll
        end up being pretty slick. Thanks for visiting!
