    <h1>Do-A-Lua</h1>
    <h2>Do a custom type.</h2>

    <p>Lua has 8 types: table, function, number, string, boolean, nil, userdata, and thread. This means that any structured data is going to be contained
        in a table, there are no arrays, dictionaries, lists, etc. and really, you don't need them. But I did notice that LÖVE has its own custom types, 
        like Image, Canvas, Transform, etc., and I thought it would be pretty fun to make my own for things like Maps and NPCs. Maybe its usefulness is
        questionable, but so is mine, so whatever.
    </p>

    <h3>Create an object.</h3>

        <p>Our object is going to start as... well, a table of course. So we'll make a <em>new</em> function, so that we can define <em>self.</em> In Lua,
            there aren't true classes, so you just use a closure like this if you want to emulate one.
        </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
        local object = {}

        function object.new()
            local self = {}
            self.type = 'custom'

            return self
        end

        local o = object.new()

        print(type(o))

        return object
        </code>
    </pre>

                <p>Output:</p> 
    <pre>
        <code>
            table
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>I've heard it said that defining 'self' feels awkward if you're coming from an OOP language. But if you're coming from another language,
        that means you're already a coder, so you should be used to feeling awkward. You can always just pass 'self' in as an argument instead, if you
        like how it looks, or use the colon operator like this <em style = "background-color: gray;">object:new()</em> 
    </p>

    <h3>Return to monkey.</h3>
    <p>Now we can write our monkey patch, which will also go inside the closure. They call it a monkey patch if you're overriding some default behavior, 
        usually by modifying the standard library. <em>Programming in Lua</em> has an example of overloading the addition (+) operator to add sets together, 
        by changing the __add metamethod. Here, we don't need to do that, there isn't a __type metatable field, so we're just going to redefine the global 
        'type' standard library function.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
        local lua_type = type
        type = function(o)
            local lua_result = lua_type(o)
            if o == self then
                return self.type
                    else
                return lua_result
            end
        end
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>So, what exactly is this doing? We're storing the standard 'type' function as 'lua_type'. Then we call it with our object as the argument, and store the 
        result in the 'lua_result' variable. Then we can compare our custom type's identity to self. If self is a custom type, we return that result (the self.custom field),
         or else we return the standard type result. Pretty nifty, eh? Here it is all together.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
        local object = {}

        function object.new()
            local self = {}
            self.type = 'custom'
        
            local lua_type = type
            type = function(o)
                local lua_result = lua_type(o)
                if o == self then
                    return self.type
                        else
                    return lua_result
                end
            end
            return self
        end
        
        local t = {}
        local test = object:new()
        
        print(type(t))
        print(type(test))
        
        return object
        </code>
    </pre>

    
    <p>Output:</p> 
    <pre>
        <code>
            table
            custom
        </code>
    </pre>

    <P>So, there you have it. It works, it's returning our custom type, and our standard type still works! So why is this a failure? Well, it doesn't work
        with LÖVE. I suppose I'm getting frontrun by however they have rerouted the type function. I'm sure one could dig into LÖVE's code
        and change it, but it seems like a bit much for just a fun little coding side quest. Or, to put it lyrically, <em>I would do anything for
        LÖVE, but I won't do that.</em>
        </em>
