    <p>A lot of algorithms used for procedural generation need to start with noise, as represented by numbers in a
        random or semi-random pattern on a grid.
        Starting out, I didn't need anything special, random noise was good enough, so I wrote my noise function like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
    local noise = {}

    function noise.new()
        local self = {}

        self.create_noise = function (grid)
        for x = 1, #grid do
            for y = 1, #grid do
                if math.random() < 0.5 then
                    grid[x][y] = 0
                else
                    grid[x][y] = 1
                end
            end
        end
        return grid
    end
        return self
    end

    return noise
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Run of the mill, (pseudo)random noise.</p>
    <img style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%; width: 70%;" src="./images/random_noise.png"></img>

    <p>Using this as a base can get decent results. Here's what it looks like after applying cellular automata, which I
        got from
        <a
            href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/generate-random-cave-levels-using-cellular-automata--gamedev-9664">here</a>
        and transcribed into Lua from (Java? C++? It occurs to me I don't know what language it is.)
    </p>

    <img style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%; width: 70%;" src="./images/cellular_automata.png"></img>

    <p>It looks really pretty good to me. It could definitely be islands, forests, or caverns, and depending on how you
        use it, there are of course
        many ways to refine it from here. Here's my <a href="./cellular_automata.html">implementation</a> in case you
        want to see it. But there is a
        problem using this to generate a lot of content, and it's that it is very <em>uniform.</em> Unless I'm changing
        other inputs on my algorithms,
        I'll always get something very similar. I'll never get a large forest clearing, or a single winding trail, or
        sparse trees dotting the
        landscape. It will always just be this blobby structure, more or less.
    </p>

    <p>Generating "good" noise is apparently a huge topic unto itself, as it's used for more than procedural generation. It's used
        for shaders, movie CGI, scientific
        simulations, and other stuff. And while there's lots of algorithms already out there- Guassian noise, Perlin
        noise, Brownian noise, Worley noise...
        I didn't really want to use them. Partly because I don't understand them (recursive filters? hardcoded permutation tables?) and
        partly because I get sick of people telling me "don't reinvent the wheel." Look, if I didn't enjoy writing my own code, I'd be
        using Unity.

    <h3>Make some noise in the hizzy!</h3>

    <p>So I set out to make some noise. Since I'm such a smart guy- <em>a wise man; a shaman,</em> I decided the best
        way to do this would be to start
        punching numbers in randomly. And of course, what I got was... unexpected?</p>

    <div style="padding-bottom:2%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%; margin-bottom: 12%;">
        <img style="width: 50%; float: left;" src="./images/noise_4.png"></img>
        <img style="width: 50%; float: right;" src="./images/noise_3.png"></img>
        <img style="width: 50%; float: right;" src="./images/noise_2.png"></img>
        <img style="width: 50%; float: left;" src="./images/noise_1.png"></img>
    </div>

    <p style="float:left;">Okay, so I'll admit, it's not exactly what I was going for. But I like it! But what is going
        on here? Well, I was already taking a float and rounding it as my input.
        And since I knew that <a href="https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/sincos.html">sine multiplied by time makes circles</a>,
        I thought I'd use <em>math.sin</em> to make my noise, I dunno, circlier, or swirlier, something.
    </p>

    <p>So, I took my table indexes, multiplied them by time, and calculated the sine, like so:
        <em style = "background-color: darkgray;">math.sin(os.clock() * i * j)</em>
    and immediately started getting some interesting stuff.</p>

    <p>After that, I just started experimenting with different numbers, adding colors, changing shapes, etc.</p>

    <p>Okay, so I haven't gotten a call from the fine folks at the Guggenheim yet. But that's okay. Remember, you're not failing <em>to</em> learn if you're
    failing <strong>to</strong> learn! Oh wait, without inflection, that's kind of ambiguous. I mean, failing in order to learn - not learning to fail, er,
     learn to... fool me... you can't get fooled again. Writing fail :P</p>
