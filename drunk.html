    <h3>It's five o'clock somewhere!</h3>
    <p>
        A 'walker' is an algorithm that keeps track of its own location as it iterates over a table. In my roguelike game Lithic, I've used walkers
        to do all kinds of nifty things. I can drop one on the player's location and clear a path to the exit, or drop one at the edge of the map and
        have it carve a river through it. It's been really versatile, and it's good practice for traversing tables. Probably the simplest walker is the
        drunk walker. I've used this one extensively as a 'seeder' to drop values that are used by later algorithms, for example his path may become
        the tops of ridges in the terrain. In each iteration, he chooses a random direction to step, and if he hasn't stepped off of the map, then he
        flips the grid to 1, indicating that it has been walked.

        <code>
    local walker = {}

    function walker:create_grid(x, y)
        self.grid = {}
        for i = 1, x do
            self.grid[i] = {}
            for j = 1, y do
                self.grid[i][j] = {}
            end
        end
        return self
    end

    function walker:drunk_walk(step)
        local self = {}
        self.x = #walker.grid / 2;
        self.y = math.floor(#walker.grid[self.x] / 2);
        for x = 1, #walker.grid do
            for y = 1, #walker.grid[x] do
            self.x = self.x + math.random(-step, step)
            self.y = self.y + math.random(-step, step)
                if self.x > 1 and self.x < #walker.grid and self.y > 1
                and self.y < #walker.grid[x] then
                    walker.grid[self.x][self.y] = 1
                end
            end
        end
        return walker.grid
    end

    return walker

    <p>This is a pretty basic example. In the video at the top, my code does a little more, the function is actually a coroutine that's called
        within a timer function. There's also a second grid that holds the number for how dark the tile should be. Hopefully, though, this gives
        you a good idea of how it works, so you and your friend, George Dickel, can code up your own walkers!

    <p>If you want to give your walker 'vision' to be able to act upon the tiles around him, you can add two more for loops under x and y.
        The range that it iterates can be -1, 1. This will iterate over 9 tiles - your drunkard's tile and the 8 adjacent ones. That way, he can
        hang a hard right if he sees an open bar, for example.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
    for x = 1, #walker.grid do
        for y = 1, #walker.grid[x] do
            for i = -1, 1 do
                for j = -1, 1 do
                    local neighbor = walker.grid[x + i][y + j]
                    if neighbor.bar.open then
                        walker:hard_right()
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Okay, so while I was writing this just now, it occurred to me that you probably don't even the first two loops. Since the walker already 
        knows his own position, so he could just start at <em style = "background-color: gray;">walker.grid[self.x - step][self.y - step]</em> 
        and go to <em style = "background-color: gray">walker.grid[self.y +step][self.y + step]</em>.
        Hmm. I don't know why I didn't think of that before. Well, I guess I'll have to test it and update this article later. Right now I need to
        go drink some coffee and sober up... woo... ugh.
