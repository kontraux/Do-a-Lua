        <h3>Enter: Fictus Avis</h3>

        <p>Ah, the majestic boid. Soaring high above the canopy-ish thing, she searches for a place to build something
            similar to a nest in which to lay her
            egglike ovals. The boid is a 'birdlike object', like a plane or Superman. The idea
            is that birds' flocking behavior, whilst appearing complex, can be simulated using only 3 simple rules. So
            let's hope that your Sims have their
            car-like objects parked in the garage, because we're about to code up a whole big mess of these things.
        </p>

        <h3>Let's objectify some boids.</h3>
        <p>If you were to explain the features of a bird to a child, how would you do it? Of course, you'd say, "Well,
            little Timmy, a bird has a color, a
            a size, a position, and 3 discrete 2 float component vectors with a clamp that prevents them from moving
            arbitrarily fast." Timmy's in 8th grade,
            he should expect some sass when he asks you to explain birds.
        </p>

        <p>Okay, so if you're like me and didn't pay attention in high school math, it's really not as complicated as it
            sounds. In class they probably
            defined a vector as a 'direction and magnitude', basically where the boid is steering and how fast it is
            going. In my roguelike game that I'm
            making, the actors have simple movement. They only have a 'position', which are the coordinates 'x' and 'y',
            and that's where they are drawn on the
            screen. If the character's goal is to move right, add to 'x', to move up, add to 'y'. Here, we can think
            about vectors the same way. But the boid has more than one goal, thus more than one vector. So we take the
            'x' from each vector and add them together, and the 'y' from each vector and add them together, and the sum
            of each are the coordinates of the
            boid's position on the screen.
        </p>

        <pre>
        <code>
    local boids = {}

    function boids.new()
        local flock = {}

        function flock.add_members(num)
            for member = 1, num do
                flock[member] = {
                    color = { 1, 1, 1, 1 };
                    scale = 1;
                    position = { x = math.random(1, screenwidth);
                                 y = math.random(1, screenheight) };
                    v1 = { x = 0.0, y = 0.0 };
                    v2 = { x = 0.0, y = 0.0 };
                    v3 = { x = 0.0, y = 0.0 };
                }
            end
            return flock
        end

        return flock
    end

    return boids
        </code>
    </pre>

        <p>Here we have our base class, 'boids', with a function to 'add_members' to the flock. Each boid gets a color
            and a size (scale), and we give it random
            coordinates so that they first appear at random positions on the screen. We'll start their 3 vectors at 0.
            We could assign another number here if we
            wanted them to start in mid-flight, but it will be better for now to keep them still because it will be
            easier to see how our other functions are
            making them behave.</p>

        <p>Since we already know we're going to have 3 functions acting on 3 components, now is as good of a time as any
            to write our update function. Remember
            that we just need to add each boid's vectors together to get their position. For those who speak pseudocode,
            the steps will be <em>'get the flock,
                then get a boid from the flock, get all the boid's vectors and add them together, and that result is the
                boid's position, and do that for every
                member of the flock'.</em>
            </em>
        </p>

        <pre>
        <code>
        function flock:update()
            for member in ipairs(flock) do
                local x = flock[member].v1.x + flock[member].v2.x + flock[member].v3.x
                local y = flock[member].v1.y + flock[member].v2.y + flock[member].v3.y
                flock[member].position.x = flock[member].position.x + x
                flock[member].position.y = flock[member].position.y + y
            end
            return flock
        end
        </code>
    </pre>

        <p>Now that we've given the breath of life to these noble creatures, let's behold them in all their glory:
        </p>

        <img src="./images/boids_1.PNG">

        <p style="margin-top: 3%">Ugh, I hate them! They're horrible, they just sit there. Well, while we've got them
            soaking in the brine and the oven is
            preheating to 425, let's see if we can't make them a little more animated with a little boid brain surgery.
            Let's start adding rules, so our update
            function can do more than just add zeroes together to no effect.</p>

        <h3>Rule 1: Compete for the center of the flock.</h3>
        <p>As David Attenborough has taught us, boids are social objects. To maintain the flock, boids will consistently
            steer to its center. This should mean
            that if a boid is far from the flock, this behavior will cause it to return, and if it's near the center, it
            should gracefully lilt about with
            other centrally located boids. Here's how I have it written:
        </p>

        <pre>
        <code>
        function flock:rule1()
            local averageX = 0
            local averageY = 0
            for member in ipairs(flock) do
                averageX = averageX + flock[member].position.x
                averageY = averageY + flock[member].position.y
            end
            averageX = averageX / #flock
            averageY = averageY / #flock
            for member in ipairs(flock) do
                if flock[member].position.x > averageX then
                    flock[member].v1.x = flock[member].v1.x - dt
                end
                if flock[member].position.x < averageX then
                    flock[member].v1.x = flock[member].v1.x + dt
                end
                if flock[member].position.y > averageY then
                    flock[member].v1.y = flock[member].v1.y - dt
                end
                if flock[member].position.y < averageY then
                    flock[member].v1.y = flock[member].v1.y + dt
                end
            end
            return flock
        end
    
    </code>
</pre>

        <p>Here, we are iterating over the flock, and adding up all of the member's positions, and then dividing by the
            size of the flock to get the
            average positions for each coordinate. Then iterating over it again, adding or subtracting dt (delta time)
            to cause the boid to move and
            steer towards the average.
        </p>

        <p>Output:</p>
        <video src="./videos/boids_1.mp4" controls></video>

        <p>I'm a computer programmer, I've never been outside, so I really can't say whether this looks like a flock of
            birds. But I have
            a feeling that we're already going off the rails a bit. First, let's point out that there is some success
            here, the boids do appear
            to be moving towards the center of the flock, and the center shifts with the movement of the boids, giving
            movement to the entire
            flock (all the way off the screen). The real problem is the way that I'm adjusting the vector. By adding or
            subtracting delta time,
            that means that a boid on one side of the flock continues to build up speed until it reaches the opposite
            side. Nearby boids do gently
            float through the center, but faraway boids don't slow down, they blast towards the flock and get flung
            through the center and pop out of
            the other side like popcorn.</p>

        <p>We could fix this by either making v1 a constant, or by applying a clamp. I've been learning a lot about
            programming lately though, so
            I know that this isn't the preferred method. Instead, I'll ignore it and hope it gets fixed in the next
            update.
        </p>

        <h3>Rule 2: Match the speed of the flock.</h3>
        <p>This one should be an easy one. <em>Famous last words.</em> We already know how to iterate through the flock
            and get an average, so
            we just need to do that with all of our vectors, and then set all of the boids' v2 to that. </p>

        <pre>
        <code>
    function flock:rule2()
        local averageX = 0
        local averageY = 0
        for member in ipairs(flock) do
            averageX = averageX + flock[member].v1.x;
            + flock[member].v2.x + flock[member].v3.x

            averageY = averageY + flock[member].v1.y;
             + flock[member].v2.y + flock[member].v3.y
        end
        averageX, averageY = averageX / #flock, averageY / #flock
        for member in ipairs(flock) do
            flock[member].v2.x = averageX / 3
            flock[member].v2.y = averageY / 3
        end
    end
    </code>
</pre>

        <p>Output:</p>

        <video src="./videos/boids_2.mp4" controls></video>
        <p>So, it's a little hard to tell in the video. Note the FPS counter I have added, I was troubleshooting this,
            it's just
            chugging a bit while I'm recording. I get ~450 FPS without OBS running in the background, and the boids move
            a lot more smoothly.
        </p>

        <p>So, I guess just take my word for now, this rule seems to be working as it should, the boids are speeding up
            and slowing down together,
            it's still a little popcorn-ey, but it's not too bad.
        </p>


        <h3>Rule 3: Avoid collisions with other boids.</h3>
        <p>We'll say that our boids are more Responsible Ravens than Lush Larks, so they'll avoid FUI (flying under the
            influence), and they'll
            be good at avoiding mid-flight collisions. So we need to do 2 new things here. One, they need to have a way
            to detect when another boid is
            too close, and two, give them some sort of evasive maneuver.
        </p>

        <pre>
        <code>
    local circle = function (cx, cy, radius, x, y)
        local dx = cx - x
        local dy = cy - y
        return dx * dx + dy * dy <= radius * radius
    end

    function flock:rule3()
        local radius = 15
        for i = 1, #flock do
            local member = flock[i]
            for j = 1, #flock do
                local neighbor = flock[j]
                local x = neighbor.position.x
                local y = neighbor.position.y
                if i ~= j then j = j + 1
                    if circle(member.position.x, member.position.y, radius, neighbor.position.x, neighbor.position.y) then
                        member.v1.x = neighbor.v2.y
                        member.v1.y = neighbor.v2.x
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end
        </code>
    </pre>

        <p>My idea here is to use a double for loop. The first loop gets the 'acting boid', i, and the second gets the
            neighbors, j, the ones we're checking
            against. We check that i does not equal j, because otherwise, the boid continually attempts to avoid a
            collision with itself. Then we have our
            local function 'circle', this gives our boid a circle around his position, with a radius of 15, and it
            checks his neighbor's position. If his
            neighbor's position falls within the circle, it returns true, and then our boid can evade.
        </p>
        <p>I'm not really sure how to make the boids evade each other. I want them to each kind of move at an angle away
            from each other so maybe just
            swapping their 'x' and 'y' from a vector would work, but I'll try actually swapping them between vectors as
            well. I will try it without
            even using vector 3. This should make
            the boids momentarily 'forget' their movement goals in order to avoid the collision. Nothing could possibly
            go wrong:
        </p>

        <video src="./videos/boids_3.mp4" controls></video>

        <p>What in the Sam Hill?!</p>

        <p>Before we start talking crazy using words like 'bug', let's recognize that the goal here was to keep the
            boids from colliding with each other.
            Technicially, my code works extremely well - they stop dead in their tracks to avoid a collision. I think
            what's making my code "too good" is
            that, by swapping vectors, it kind of causes a cascading effect. Since there are so many boids, they're all
            near another boid, so all of their
            v1s are nullified right away, and all that's left is v2, which is the average speed of the flock. And the
            average speed is pretty low, since
            they're all locked in some strange, paralytic dance.
        </p>

        <p>Still, it's kind of neat in a way. Let's run the simulaton a few more times.</p>

        <video src="./videos/boids_4.mp4" controls></video>

        <p>To stop them from freezing, let's bring our vector 3 into play. Instead of swapping our boid's v1 with our
            neighbor's v2, let's take our neighbor's
            v1, multiply it by -1, and that will be our boid's v3. This should make them move in the opposite direction
            of nearby boids.
        </p>

        <video src="./videos/boids_5.mp4" controls></video>

        <p>Now they either just float together, or bounce off of each other like pingpong balls. I tried a bunch of
            different things here, all with varying
            degrees of success. Nothing worked perfectly. Have a look:
        </p>

            <tr>

        <h3 style="clear:both">Rule 0: Steal someone else's code.</h3>
        <p>I'm using the word 'steal' for comedic effect, everything that I've looked at using actually has a permissive
            license. Being self-taught, I'm both
            the student and the teacher, and the teacher part has decided that using someone else's code here is fine,
            as the student is still going to get
            some practice transcribing it from the source language into Lua.
        </p>
        <p>This ended up being a moot point anyway. I just can't find anything I like enough to rip off. The boids are
            either too simple (like spawning at one
            edge of the screen and flying with a fixed speed to the other) or too complex (like a 15k line C++
            scientific simulation of a murmur written
            by real life bird scientists at universities). There seems to be no 'Goldilocks boid code'- hey, I think
            that's the name of a band. Which brings
            us to boid rule 5 of 3.
        </p>
